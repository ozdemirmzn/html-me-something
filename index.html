                <h2>Istanbul, TURKEY</h2>
                <p>Though most of my extended family is from Missouri, I was born in Boulder, Colorado, at Boulder County Hospital. My mother lived in Boulder for a few years in the early 1980s, but we returned to Missouri early enough in my live that I don't have any recollection of living there. Still, it's a beautiful place that I still like to claim as my original home. We returned frequently over the years to visit family friends, and to explore Boulder Canyon and nearby Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>

                <h2>Houston, TX</h2>
                <p>My grandparents on both sides lived most of their lives in various small towns in Iron County. When I was young, both maternal and paternal grandparents lived on opposite sides of Ironton, a quaint town on the edge of the beautiful Arcadia Valley. Upon moving back from Colorado, we lived nearby in Ironton for a short time.</p>

                <h2>Kansas City, MO</h2>
                <p>My preschool years were spent crawling around in a four-family flat on Arsenal, half a block east of Grand and Tower Grove Park. I do have some memories from these years, including hot summer nights with the windows open and a fan on high, trying to piece together dinner that didn't involve turning on the oven or stove.</p>
